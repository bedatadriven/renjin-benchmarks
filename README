This is the Renjin benchmarking suite, which should help us compare 
Renjin preformance to the original interpreter, track improvements in
performance over time, and prevent performance regressions.

The suite and its harness are written in R, and so can be run either from Renjin or R2.x.

With Renjin:
===========

Launch the r.benchmarks.Benchmarks class from Eclipse with the working
directory set to renjin/benchmarks

With R2.X:
=========

cd renjin/benchmarks
Rscript src/main/R/runner.R



Note: The matrix benchmarks involve very large matrices on which the pure-java matrix
routines fare quite poorly. Visit http://code.google.com/p/netlib-java/ for instructions 
on building the JNI interface to the native matrix libraries.


TODO:
====

-Save results to database/local disk for tracking over time
-Associate results with SVN revision number / build number
-Write analysis script to compare results with original interpreter and to past builds

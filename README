This is the Renjin benchmarking suite, which should help us compare 
Renjin preformance to the original interpreter, track improvements in
performance over time, and prevent performance regressions.

The suite and its harness are written in R, and so can be run either from Renjin or GNU R

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

# Running

To run benchmarks against the latest version of Renjin:

    ./gradlew run
    
    
To run benchmarks against the local version of GNU R:

    ./gradlew -Pgnu run
    

# Todo

   [ ] Add build steps to checkout and build different version of GNU R and Renjin
   [ ] Survey benchmark
   [ ] Genome benchmark
   [ ] Reporting to benchmarks.renjin.org

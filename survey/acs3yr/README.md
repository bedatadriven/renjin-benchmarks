# American Community Survey (ACS) 3-year

Calculation of replicate means of the results from the
[American Community Survey](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/).

This benchmark was discussed in the presentation
"R as a Query Language" presented at 
[R Summit & Workshop in Copenhagen 2015](http://www.renjin.org/blog/2015-06-28-renjin-at-rsummit-2015.html) and at 
[RIOT 2015](http://www.renjin.org/blog/2015-09-09-riot-workshop-presentation.html)

This work is the result of a collaboration between BeDataDriven and
Hannes MÃ¼hleisen from CWI which is sponsored by the
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.
